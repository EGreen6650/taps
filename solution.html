<div class="textmargin">
<p>The issue of pollution across the world has had great impacts on everyone's lives. Each day, the status of the environment rapidly declines. Without a healthy environment, the world could not survive. As a team, we have recognized this issue and we agree that we need to do everything in our best efforts to help. </p>

<div class="solutionimgleft">

</div>
<div class="textmargin">
<p>Our solution is to use technology to connect individuals with the environment so that they can build healthier surroundings for everyone. Our goal through this is to be able to create a world where future generations can live in the same or even better health of nature than we have today. We want to be able to advance the ecological health of our environment while being able to keep up with the ongoing advancement of technology as well.</p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>
<div class="textmargin">
<p> We fulfill our goal by providing a list of locations of local disposal and recycling centers to the users. With this information, people can become more aware of where and what they can dispose of or recycle to create more eco-friendly communities for people to share. Through this system, users will also be able to learn about the impact that their awareness and preventative actions can have on their surroundings and their communities.</p>
